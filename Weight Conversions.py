# I created this program to help myself to convert Kilograms to Pounds and vice versa

kg = int(input("Kilograms to Pounds. Please enter value in kilograms: "))
pound = 2.205

result = kg * pound 

print(f"{result} Pounds")

print("Pounds to Kilograms. Please enter value in pounds.")
x = float(input('Pounds: '))
print(x * .454)
